  abstract = {Are syntactic categories like noun and verb categories of stems, such that the noun and verb versions of ambiguous stems like hammer are distinct, though related, lexical items, or are syntactic categories carried by affixes attached to uncategorized roots, such that noun and verb versions of ambiguous stems are derived forms built on a single root? This paper addresses the representational question posed by syntactic categories by examining the processing of category ambiguous words. If syntactic categories are in fact categories of stems, category ambiguity should yield processing uncertainty parallel to that engendered by other forms of lexical ambiguity, such as homophony. On the other hand, if syntactic categories result from affixation, category ambiguity should yield processing uncertainty parallel to that engendered by syntactic uncertainty, at least if morphological structure reduces to syntactic structure as claimed by Distributed Morphology. A magnetoencephalographic (MEG) experiment exploiting a single word lexical decision task supports the syntactic over the lexical account of syntactic categories; category ambiguity parallels syntactic ambiguity rather than lexical ambiguity. The paper illustrates how neurolinguistic data can contribute to testing competing representational theories, but only when tight linking hypotheses are motivated connecting linguistic theory, cognitive processing, and neural responses.},

@article{GwilliamsEtAlSpokenWord,
  abstract = {Speech is an inherently noisy and ambiguous signal. In order to fluently derive meaning, a listener must integrate contextual information to guide interpretations of the sensory input. While many studies have demonstrated the influence of prior context, the neural mechanisms supporting the integration of subsequent information remain unknown. Using magnetoencephalography, we analysed responses to spoken words with a varyingly ambiguous onset phoneme, the identity of which is later disambiguated at the lexical uniqueness point. Our results uncover a three-level processing network. Subphonemic detail is preserved in primary auditory cortex over long timescales, and re-evoked at subsequent phoneme positions. Commitments to phonological categories occur in parallel, resolving on the shorter time-scale of ~450 ms. Finally, predictions are formed over likely lexical items. These findings provide evidence that future input determines the perception of earlier speech sounds by maintaining sensory features until they can be optimally integrated with top-down information.},

  abstract ={Determining the correct form of a verb in context requires an
understanding of the syntactic structure of the sentence. Recurrent
neural networks have been shown to perform this task
with an error rate comparable to humans, despite the fact that
they are not designed with explicit syntactic representations.
To examine the extent to which the syntactic representations
of these networks are similar to those used by humans when
processing sentences, we compare the detailed pattern of errors
that RNNs and humans make on this task. Despite significant
similarities (attraction errors, asymmetry between singular
and plural subjects), the error patterns differed in important
ways. In particular, in complex sentences with relative clauses
error rates increased in RNNs but decreased in humans. Furthermore,
RNNs showed a cumulative effect of attractors but
humans did not. We conclude that at least in some respects the
syntactic representations acquired by RNNs are fundamentally
different from those used by humans.},

@inproceedings{vanSchijndel2018,
  abstract = {The disambiguation of syntactically ambiguous sentences can
lead to reading difficulty, often referred to as a garden path effect.
The surprisal hypothesis suggests that this difficulty can
be accounted for using word predictability. We tested this hypothesis
using predictability estimates derived from two families
of language models: grammar-based models, which explicitly
encode the syntax of the language; and recurrent neural
network (RNN) models, which do not. Both classes of models
correctly predicted increased difficulty in ambiguous sentences
compared to controls, suggesting that the syntactic representations
induced by RNNs are sufficient for this purpose.
At the same time, surprisal estimates derived from all models
systematically underestimated the magnitude of the effect,
and failed to predict the difference between easier (NP/S) and
harder (NP/Z) ambiguities. This suggests that it may not be
possible to reduce garden path effects to predictability.},

  abstract = {Syntactic rules in human language usually refer to the hierarchical
structure of sentences. However, the input during language
acquisition can often be explained equally well with
rules based on linear order. The fact that children consistently
ignore these linear explanations to instead settle on hierarchical
explanations has been used to argue for an innate hierarchical
bias in humans. We revisit this argument by using recurrent
neural networks (RNNs), which have no hierarchical
bias, to simulate the acquisition of question formation, a hierarchical
transformation, in an artificial language modeled after
English. Even though this transformation could be explained
with a linear rule, we find that some RNN architectures consistently
learn the correct hierarchical rule instead. This finding
suggests that hierarchical cues within the language are suf-
ficient to induce a preference for hierarchical generalization.
This conclusion is strengthened by the finding that adding an
additional hierarchical cue, namely syntactic agreement, further
improves performance.},

@article{TalLinzen&YoheiOseki2015,
abstract= {The reliability of acceptability judgments made by individual linguists has often been called
into question. Recent large-scale replication studies conducted in response to this criticism
have shown that the majority of published English acceptability judgments are robust. We
make two observations about these replication studies. First, we raise the concern that English
acceptability judgments may be more reliable than judgments in other languages. Second, we
argue that it is unnecessary to replicate judgments that illustrate uncontroversial descriptive facts;
rather, candidates for replication can emerge during formal or informal peer review. We present
two experiments motivated by these arguments. Published Hebrew and Japanese acceptability
contrasts considered questionable by the authors of the present paper were rated for acceptability
by a large sample of naive participants. Approximately half of the contrasts did not replicate.
We suggest that the reliability of acceptability judgments, especially in languages other than
English, can be improved using a simple open review system, and that formal experiments are
only necessary in controversial cases.},
