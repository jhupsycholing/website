## 

What are the mental representations that constitute our knowledge of language? How do we use them to understand and produce language?


We address these questions using computational models and human experiments.Â The goal of our models is to mimic the processes that humans engage in when learning and processing language; these models often combine techniques from machine learning with representations from theoretical linguistics.

We then compare the predictions of these models to human language comprehension. In a typical experiment in our lab, we invite participants to read a range of sentences, and record how long they take to read each word, measured based on key presses or eye movements. Other techniques include artificial language learning experiments and neural measurements.

Finally, we use linguistics and psycholinguistics to understand and improve artificial intelligence systems, in particular "deep learning" models that are otherwise difficult to analyze.
